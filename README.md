## Project Overview
This is the second project of the University of Santa Barbara bootcamp where I am to create a website with a search engine. The main purpose of this project is to practice CSS and JavaScript skills and incorporating an api call. For this second project I have created a Giphy search engine that:
-allows users to enter and submit a keyword
-makes a request to the Giphy api based on that keyword
-receives and parses the response
-displays images on the page from that response
-uses a custom css grid to display the images
-ensures the site is responsive so that it looks good/works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## User Stories
- Searching for Memes

  As a user, I want to be able to search for specific memes using keywords in the search bar. I should be able to enter my desired search term and hit the "Search" button. The application should then fetch and display a collection of relevant memes from the GIPHY API based on my search. The displayed memes should be in a scrollable list, and I should be able to see up to 100 memes at a time on the screen.

- Browsing Memes

  
  As a user, I want to be able to scroll through a collection of memes and explore them. After performing a search or accessing the application, I should see a list of memes displayed on the screen. I should be able to scroll through the list and view multiple memes at a time. The application should load additional memes as I reach the end of the current list, allowing me to browse and discover new memes effortlessly.

- Adjusting Meme Display Quantity
  
  As a user, I want to have control over the number of memes displayed on the screen. After performing a search or accessing the application, I should see a default number of memes displayed. I should have the ability to adjust the quantity of memes shown at once, allowing me to view more or fewer memes based on my preference. By giving me control over the display quantity, the application allows for a customized browsing experience.

## Ideas for Future Improvement
- Light & dark modes
- Click to copy GIF functionality
- Filter GIFs by rating(PG,PG-13 etc.)
- Filter GIFs by language
