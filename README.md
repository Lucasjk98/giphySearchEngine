## Project Overview
This is the second project of the University of Santa Barbara bootcamp where I am to create a website with a search engine. The main purpose of this project is to practice CSS and JavaScript skills and incorporating an api call. For this second project I have created a Giphy search engine that:
-allows users to enter and submit a keyword
-makes a request to the Giphy api based on that keyword
-receives and parses the response
-displays images on the page from that response
-uses a custom css grid to display the images
-ensures the site is responsive so that it looks good/works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Ideas for Future Improvement
- Light & dark modes
- Click to copy GIF functionality
- Filter GIFs by rating(PG,PG-13 etc.)
- Filter GIFs by language
